			<p class="mb-4">Hi, I'm Samad</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				Actually, this is my fourth time writing my "About Me"... mostly because I'm not entirely
				sure who I am. I change a lot, and sometimes I even forget myself.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				But here are a few things that don't change: I'm an introvert... and sometimes an
				extrovert.., it's called a borrowed personality.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				Technology has always been my world. I eat, sleep, and breathe it. I honestly can‚Äôt go a day
				without tinkering with some kind of gadget. My love for coding began when I was 10, after my
				uncle, who was studying software engineering, introduced me to HTML. I was blown away by the
				idea that you could talk to a machine and make it follow your commands. My first ‚ÄúHello,
				World‚Äù felt like unlocking a secret level and I immediately decided my destiny: professional
				hacker. (By ‚Äúhacker‚Äù I mean the cool movie kind who types furiously and saves the world.
				lol.)
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				Since then, my curiosity has never stopped. I'm always eager to explore new programming
				languages, software, frameworks...anything tech-related.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				<s
					>Currently, I work as a crew member at McDonald's and part-time as a computing teacher for
					middle and high school students. I'm also a student at Brunel University London,
					studying... well, guess what?</s

			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				Recently, I stumbled into the world of Linux. For someone as curious as me, it's been both
				the worst and the best mistake I've made... I've become a full-time tinkerer, proudly
				holding an unofficial certification in "breaking stuff and automating everything." üòÇ
			</p>

			<p>
				These days, I‚Äôm all-in on Nix flakes and NixOS. I use Nix to develop, manage, and deploy
				everything from personal devices and servers to websites. By day, I work in software
				development and infrastruture optimization. By night, you‚Äôll find me fully immersed in
				either my homelab or watching a tv show.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4">
				A few of my hobbies (in no particular order):
				<ul>
					<li>Running (short distances... not a marathoner!)</li>
					<li>Hiking (gotta touch grass now and then)</li>
					<li>Camping (tents, campfires, and s'mores... yes please)</li>
					<li>Gaming (when life allows)</li>
					<li>Photography(Once a profession</li>
				</ul>
