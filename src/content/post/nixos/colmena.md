So, Iâ€™ve been having this issue with Colmena. I added the Colmena input to my `flake.nix` for my system and also exposed it as an output so both my flake and NixOS can make use of it. But hereâ€™s the problemâ€”itâ€™s not visible to my system. When I try to use it, itâ€™s just not there.

At first, I thought maybe I messed up the configuration or missed an update in the documentation. For now, Iâ€™ve been using it via `nix-shell`, which works, but I have to pass the `--impure` flag, and honestly, Iâ€™m not a fan of that. Letâ€™s fix this.

---

### Step 1: Adding Colmena Input to Flake
First, I added Colmena as an input in my `flake.nix`:
```nix
    # ADDED: Colmena input
    colmena.url = "github:zhaofengli/colmena";
```

Then, I added it to the outputs:
```nix
  outputs =
    {
      self,
      home-manager,
      nixpkgs,
      nix-colors,
      ghostty,
      agenix,
      disko,
      colmena,
      ...
  };
```

---

### Step 2: Running `nix flake check`
When I ran `nix flake check`, I got these warnings:
```
warning: unknown flake output 'colmena'
warning: unknown flake output 'colmenaHive'
```

This confused me because I followed the exact setup from the official Colmena documentation on using flakes: [Colmena Using Flakes](https://colmena.cli.rs/unstable/tutorial/flakes.html).

Hereâ€™s my current Colmena config in the flake:
```nix
  colmenaHive = colmena.lib.makeHive self.outputs.colmena;
      colmena = {
        meta = {
          nixpkgs = import nixpkgs {
            system = "x86_64-linux";
          };
        };

        # Deployment Nodes
        demo = {
          deployment = {
            targetHost = "demo";
            targetPort = 22;
            targetUser = "thein3rovert";
            buildOnTarget = true;
            tags = [ "homelab" ]; # TODO: Change tag later
          };
          imports = [
            ./hosts/demo
            inputs.disko.nixosModules.disko
          ];
          time.timeZone = "Europe/London";
        };
      };
```

The issue is that my flake isnâ€™t detecting the `colmena` output. It says Colmena now uses a new output called `colmenaHive`, which I already exposed. For now, Iâ€™ll hold off on using Colmena from the input flake and try it with `nix-shell` instead:

```sh
nix shell github:zhaofengli/colmena
```

### Second Issue: Infinite Recursion in Shell
When I tried running Colmena commands from the shell, I hit another error:
```
error: infinite recursion encountered
       at /nix/store/126fp22lvqmnfv1p290vcpmbf8yab4a5-source/lib/modules.nix:652:66:
          651|       extraArgs = mapAttrs (
          652|         name: _: addErrorContext (context name) (args.${name} or config._module.args.${name})
             |                                                                  ^
          653|       ) (functionArgs f);
[ERROR] -----
[ERROR] Operation failed with error: Child process exited with error code: 1
Hint: Backtrace available - Use `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

I wasnâ€™t sure where this recursion was coming from, but based on the error, I suspected it was caused by excessive use of:
```nix
specialArgs = { inherit inputs outputs nix-colors; };
```

The infinite recursion error was likely caused by passing the `inputs` argument to modules that were already declared elsewhere. Since I have a common folder shared between hosts, this was creating conflicts.

Using `--show-trace`, I traced the issue to this part of my config:
```
 from call site
         at /nix/store/wnj1d9ysl3k95rpajdkdm8a5igl7ywa7-source/hosts/common/default.nix:12:5:
           11|     ./users
           12|     inputs.home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager
             |     ^
           13|   ];
...
   â€¦ while evaluating the module argument `inputs' in "/nix/store/wnj1d9ysl3k95rpajdkdm8a5igl7ywa7-source/hosts/common":

       error: infinite recursion encountered
```

To troubleshoot, I removed the Colmena config from my `flake.nix` input and the hive config entirely. Using only the Colmena shell, I ran `colmena apply` again and got this error:
```
[INFO ] Using flake: git+file:///home/thein3rovert/thein3rovert-flake
error: flake 'git+file:///home/thein3rovert/thein3rovert-flake' does not provide attribute 'packages.x86_64-linux.colmenaHive', 'legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.colmenaHive' or 'colmenaHive'
[ERROR] -----
[ERROR] Operation failed with error: Child process exited with error code: 1
Hint: Backtrace available - Use `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

Turns out, Colmena expects the `colmenaHive` output to be present. To fix this, I stopped adding the common config to the new VM, so it doesnâ€™t contain the conflicting `home-manager` configuration.

### The Fix
I finally figured out the issue. Colmena behaves differently from `nixos-rebuild` when it comes to passing flake inputs. With `nixos-rebuild`, flake inputs are automatically passed to all modules. With Colmena, you need to explicitly pass them.

Initially, I was doing this:
```nix
{
  inputs = {
    # ... existing inputs

    # Uncomment and fix Colmena input
    colmena = {
      url = "github:zhaofengli/colmena";
    };
  };

  # ...
}
```

But this only passes the Colmena GitHub URL without including the flake inputs. Hereâ€™s the correct way:
```nix
{
  inputs = {
    # ... existing inputs

    # Uncomment and fix Colmena input
    colmena = {
      url = "github:zhaofengli/colmena";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs"; # Pass in the flake input
    };
  };

  # ...
}
```

Then, in the Colmena configuration within the flake, I needed to pass the inputs to all nodes using the `specialArgs` function:
```nix
colmena = {
  meta = {
    nixpkgs = import nixpkgs {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
    };
    # Pass inputs to all nodes
    specialArgs = { inherit inputs outputs; };
  };
};
```

According to the latest Colmena release, if youâ€™re using the newest version, the `colmenaHive` output must be present in your flake. As stated in the documentation:
> Colmena reads the `colmenaHive` output in your Flake, generated with `colmena.lib.makeHive`.

You can read more about it in their official documentation [here](https://colmena.cli.rs/unstable/tutorial/flakes.html).

Since Iâ€™m running the older version of Colmena via `nix-shell`, I donâ€™t need to worry about the `colmenaHive` output. However, when deploying a new node, I still have to add the `--impure` flag:
```bash
colmena apply --on <nodename> --impure
```

And it should deploy successfully:
```
INFO ] Selected all 1 nodes.
      ðŸ•‘ 4s 1 running
 demo ðŸ•‘ 4s     'github:nixos/nixpkgs/77b584d61ff80b4cef9245829a6f1dfad5afdfa3?narHash=sha256-bmEPmSjJakAp/JojZRrUvNcDX2R5/nuX6b
```

### Key Insights and Takeaways
1. **Explicit Input Passing**: Unlike `nixos-rebuild`, Colmena requires you to explicitly pass flake inputs to all modules using `specialArgs`.
2. **ColmenaHive Requirement**: If youâ€™re using the latest version of Colmena, ensure your flake exposes the `colmenaHive` output.
3. **Avoid Infinite Recursion**: Be cautious when sharing configurations between hosts. Conflicts in `specialArgs` or overlapping inputs can lead to infinite recursion errors.
4. **Use `--show-trace`**: This flag is invaluable for debugging issues in your configuration.

### What Iâ€™d Do Differently
- **Read the Docs Thoroughly**: I would double-check the latest Colmena documentation before diving into implementation.
- **Test Incrementally**: Instead of adding everything at once, Iâ€™d test each part of the configuration step-by-step to catch issues early.
- **Avoid Legacy Methods**: While using `nix-shell` worked as a temporary fix, Iâ€™d aim to transition fully to the latest Colmena features and workflows.
