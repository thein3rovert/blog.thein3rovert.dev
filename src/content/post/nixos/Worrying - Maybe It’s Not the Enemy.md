# Worrying: Maybe Itâ€™s Not the Enemy?

I am currently reading a book on worry because I thought it was a very important thing for me to address, especially for myself. I know other people also worry. When I refer to worry, I mean **being always constantly worried about the future**. It involves ending up **creating scenarios that are bad for you**. You overthink that scenario to the extent that you feel there is always going to be a bad outcome from it.

I do not know if anyone else feels this way, but I certainly do. I worry too much. I think this is because I am a very overthinking person. I am unsure if that is a good thing or a bad thing. Maybe in some cases it is good, but honestly, not in all cases. My entire day is spent thinking about future things that might not go the way I expect.

I create these scenarios, such as:
- "What if I get to this place and this happens?"
- "What if this person actually does this, and this bad thing happens?"
- "What if I actually get what I want, but something comes up again, and I lost it all?"

I constantly worry about everything, and my brain just does not stop. Sometimes this overwhelming feeling makes me feel really sick. I realize I spent my entire day worried about something, but those worries did not turn out to be true. That worry is only in my thought; that is not reality. When the actual event happens in the next few days, **it is completely different from what I imagined it would be**. It goes completely well, and what I thought would happen actually goes right.

## A Shift in Perspective

I have decided now to stop, not to stop worrying but to stop creating these negative scenarios whenever I feel worried. Although I haven't finished the book I am reading yet, I was able to pick up a few key things. The book states that **worrying is good**. It is very good to worry, which sounds weird, but the book states this. It says that when you worry, it is a sign. It specifies **worrying as a means to solving problems**.

The book explains that the reason we worry is because **our mind wants us to solve a particular problem**. It wants us to find the solution. There is no way for us to find a solution to a problem if we do not worry about it. Therefore, worrying means we need to find a solution. It is quite funny, but true: if we decide to remove our worries, how would we solve our problems? We would not worry about the problem, and thus it would not be solved.

I usually think of worrying as a bad thing. I believe this interpretation comes from culture. When I translate the English word 'worry' into a word in my culture, it carries a totally different meaning. I associated 'worry' with a word in my culture called **ironu**. **Ironu** is defined as overthinking. Although overthinking and worrying are two completely different things, I tend to see them as the same, because my mind overthinks and worries simultaneously.

## The Real Issue: Overthinking the Worry

Worrying is good. **It is the overthinking that is not good**. You cannot completely take worrying out of your life because it is necessary. I need to be able to worry about things because I need to find solutions for them. What I must stop doing is **overthinking the worry**. Overthinking leads to creating fake scenarios in my head, resulting in a lot of anxiety and nauseousness. I feel sick, and my entire day does not go well. The haunting scenarios created in my mind based on my worries are what cause me to have a bad day eventually.

To clarify: Overthinking is not a good thing to do. **Worrying is good because it helps us solve our problems**, but overthinking is a very different thing.

That is all I have for today. I am going for a walk, and I just wanted to share this insight. I plan to continue reading the book because I feel like I will learn a lot from it that would help me. As I discover new things, I will share them.
